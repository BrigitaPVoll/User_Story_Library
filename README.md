Definition af user story 

A FAIR user story is a concrete, description of who needs what kind of data, for what purpose, and under what conditions, such that the data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable to successfully achieve that goal.

A guiding question in understanding what a FAIR user story is: 

“Could someone other than the original data creator realistically find, understand, and reuse this data in the future?”
What allowed that to happen?
